## Rationale and Overview

### Why This Tool Exists

The Wayback Scanner was designed to track the evolution of Colossal Biosciences' website messaging over time. As a company at the forefront of de-extinction technology, Colossal's public communications provide valuable insights into:

- **Strategic positioning changes** - How the company presents its mission and goals
- **Technical progress updates** - Evolution of claims about capabilities and timelines
- **Market messaging shifts** - Changes in how they address funding, partnerships, and commercial viability
- **Public relations adaptations** - Responses to criticism, regulatory changes, or scientific developments

### Core Problem Solved

Traditional web monitoring only captures current states. This tool leverages the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to:

1. **Reconstruct historical website states** across multiple years
2. **Quantify changes** using semantic similarity algorithms
3. **Track keyword trends** across specific topics (ethics, timelines, technology, etc.)
4. **Generate actionable reports** for researchers, journalists, and analysts

### Key Innovation

Unlike simple screenshot comparisons, this system:
- Extracts semantic content from HTML while preserving structure
- Uses cosine distance on character n-grams for change detection
- Provides multi-dimensional magnitude scoring for different types of changes
- Generates both machine-readable CSV data and human-readable markdown reports

## Data Collection Process

### Snapshot Sampling Strategy

The system uses intelligent sampling to balance temporal resolution with processing efficiency:

**Quarterly Sampling** (default for historical analysis):
- Selects 4 representative snapshots per year
- Captures major seasonal updates and campaigns
- Reduces processing time while maintaining trend visibility

**Monthly Sampling** (for detailed analysis):
- Selects 12 snapshots per year
- Captures more granular changes and iterative updates
- Higher processing cost but better change detection

### URL Path Selection

Currently monitored paths (configurable via `CANONICAL_PATHS`):
- `/` - Homepage (primary messaging)
- `/about` - Company description and mission
- `/science` - Technical approach and capabilities
- `/species` - Target species and project status
- `/news` - Press releases and updates

### Error Handling

The collection process is designed for resilience:
- **Network Failures**: Skips failed downloads, continues with remaining snapshots
- **Parsing Errors**: Logs HTML parsing issues, saves partial content
- **Missing Snapshots**: Handles gaps in Wayback Machine coverage gracefully
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements delays between requests to respect archive.org policies

---

## Diff Analysis Methodology

### Change Detection Algorithm

**Step 1: Text Preprocessing**
- Remove source URL differences (focus on content changes)
- Normalize whitespace and formatting
- Preserve semantic structure while reducing noise

**Step 2: Similarity Calculation**
- Generate character 3-grams from both text versions
- Create frequency vectors for statistical comparison
- Calculate cosine distance between vectors
- Apply significance threshold (default: 0.05)

**Step 3: Contextual Diff Generation**
- Create unified diff with 3 lines of context
- Filter out trivial changes (very short additions/deletions)
- Focus on substantive content modifications
- Preserve meaningful structural changes

**Step 4: Semantic Analysis**
- Count keyword occurrences in both versions
- Calculate frequency deltas across topic categories
- Identify shifts in messaging emphasis
- Track terminology evolution over time

### Significance Threshold

**Current Setting**: 0.05 cosine distance
- **Rationale**: Captures meaningful changes while filtering noise
- **Calibration**: Based on analysis of known significant updates
- **Adjustment**: Can be lowered to 0.01 for hyper-sensitive detection

### False Positive Mitigation

**Source URL Filtering**: Ignores changes in archive URLs that don't reflect content changes
**Length Filtering**: Skips very short text changes that are likely formatting artifacts
**Context Preservation**: Maintains surrounding text to distinguish meaningful changes from noise
**Category Weighting**: Emphasizes changes in high-impact keyword categories

## Magnitude Scoring System

### Rationale

Simple similarity scores don't capture the full complexity of website changes. The magnitude scoring system provides multi-dimensional assessment:

### Individual Metrics

**1. Similarity Score (30% weight)**
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Calculation**: 1.0 minus cosine distance
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more similar content
- **Use Case**: Overall content stability assessment

**2. Character Change Ratio (20% weight)**
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Calculation**: |new_length - old_length| / average_length
- **Interpretation**: Proportion of content that changed in size
- **Use Case**: Detecting major content additions or removals

**3. Diff Density (25% weight)**
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Calculation**: changed_lines / total_lines
- **Interpretation**: Intensity of line-by-line changes
- **Use Case**: Distinguishing between focused edits and wholesale rewrites

**4. Keyword Intensity (15% weight)**
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Calculation**: sum(|keyword_deltas|) / baseline_keyword_count
- **Interpretation**: Magnitude of topic emphasis shifts
- **Use Case**: Tracking strategic messaging changes

**5. Structural Score (10% weight)**
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Calculation**: (additions + deletions) / max_content_lines
- **Interpretation**: Structural reorganization magnitude
- **Use Case**: Detecting layout and organization changes

### Combined Magnitude Score

**Formula**:
```
magnitude = (similarity * 0.3) + (char_ratio * 0.2) + (diff_density * 0.25) + (keyword_intensity * 0.15) + (structural * 0.1)
```

**Calibration**: Weights based on empirical analysis of known significant changes

### Change Categories

**Major (≥0.8)**:
- Complete page redesigns
- Fundamental strategy pivots
- New product announcements

**Substantial (≥0.6)**:
- Significant messaging updates
- Major feature additions
- Important policy changes

**Moderate (≥0.4)**:
- Content updates and expansions
- Minor messaging adjustments
- Regular maintenance updates

**Minor (≥0.2)**:
- Small content additions
- Typo corrections
- Minor formatting changes

**Minimal (<0.2)**:
- Trivial edits
- Technical updates
